# Welcome to iaxixi-max

This is a React UI component library built with TypeScript and styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

You can install the library using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install iaxixi-max
# or
yarn add iaxixi-max
```

## Usage

Import and use components in your React application:

```jsx
import { YourComponent } from 'iaxixi-max';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <YourComponent label="Hello, World!" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

*(Replace `YourComponent` with the actual name of a component from your library.)*

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

This library is designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. Ensure you have Tailwind CSS set up in your project.

Make sure your main CSS file includes the Tailwind directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Refer to the individual component stories for specific examples and props.
